**The Basics:**

This is an idea for a game that relies on genetic algorithms, and how people can grow or evolve their own custom creatures from scratch, to compete against each other.

These are some necessary parts to the game:

- Random critter starting - so you can end up with different results
- Fitness schedule - so you have some parameters on how your creature may change
- Boost fitness button- so your can promote something you like despite it not being fit
- Filtering of creatures-killing off one at a time, or all that look like X.(Some filter)
 Creature editor.
- Multiplayer - so it can be competitive
- Creature market - A place where you can buy other peoples creatures so you can buy and sell them
- Passive evolution - so when looking at it you can see a notable difference

Here are some things that&#39;d be added in later or not at all:

- Crossbreeding - where you can mix two creatures for a new one
- Modes - multiple ways in which your creature can compete with others
- Maps - multiple maps to complete with the same mode
- Aesthetics - little decorational meshes and textures they could pay for
- Tournaments - just to increase popularity
- Ranking - where you can rank your creature to gauge how good it is

**References to work with:**

This is a good representation of

for how the creature market should

be. Something important about the

market is that people put their creatures on the market so other people can buy them.

**The Evolution Mechanics:**

-

**The Market Mechanics:**

- The game market will be run in the final game on the block chain, with each creature being a non-fungible token.
- You can see everyone else&#39;s creature and even play against them but must buy, trade, or attain their creature in some manner, to use it as your own
- Ideally you can have multiple very similar creatures in the game
- There will be a public ranking of the creatures, and in it you can the stats of the best creatures
- You are able to sell and grow new creatures at will and can possible (because they are nfts) make really money from doing so
